## [Unreleased]

* :wrench: [#3] add changelog and automation support. PR [#4](https://github.com/rickhaffey/gorgeous-stew/pull/4) by [@rickhaffey](https://github.com/rickhaffey).

## 0.0.0

Keep Here For Now Until We Have More Changes.  Once we have a version bump,
we can remove this section.

It's only needed to support initial changelog automation - to give the automation
a hint as to where it should insert new changes.
